	<h1>Shantou</h1>
	<h2>Everything about Shantou</h2>
	<p>Shantou is one of the cities in Guangdong, China, which is where my parents from. This is a place with full of
		traditional cultures where people here maintain most part of religious rituals adapting from ancient China.

		Seafood might be one of the most identical cuisines in Shantou. As a coastal city in South China, people around
		here consider seafood as their dominant part of the diet. Fish, crab, shrimp, and scallop around here are so fresh
		that some of them can even be eaten raw. What’s more, the hotpot serve with fresh and juicy beef is another
		signature in Shantou, which creates a distinctive hotpot style from Sichuan spicy hotpot.</p>
	<h2>Must Go (Eat)</h2>
	<h3>1. Chao Wei Ju Restaurant</h3>
	<caption><a href="https://www.chaoweiju.com/">Explore more</a></caption>
	<p>The one you can have the closest taste of Shantou cuisine in the US (but sill awful). It offers many traditional
		Shantou cuisines like beef hotpot and rice noodle, at least they’ve tried their best to introduce the food
		overseas. Their rice noodle is better than I expected. </p>
	<h3>2. Wu Ji Beef Soup</h3>
	<caption><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/axBUwsN1VhHoqP5Z9">Explore more</a></caption>
	<p>“Wu Ji” stands for “Wu’s”, it a common way for Chinese people to name their shops by their last name. Serves the
		best beef hotpot and other beef-related cuisine. You can observe how the chef cuts and delivers the raw beef to
		your table. The slices of beef are so thin and fresh that is can be well-done to eat once you drop them into the
		pot for 8 seconds.</p>
	<h3>3. Zhao Ji Rice Noodle</h3>

	<p>Same case, this restaurant is opened by a Zhao guy. I tried its pork rice noodle and it’s tasty! They will fry the
		chopped green onion and place into a bowl of lard and it becomes a topping for rice noodle with freshness.</p>
	<h3>4. Long Hu Downtown District</h3>
	<caption><a href="maps.app.goo.gl/nUPS24XKCqLxLptq9">Explore more</a></caption>
	<p>“Long Hu” means dragon lake. It is one of the most well-developed district in Shantou with tons of restaurant.
		They are no “wrong choices”, only unique experience on Shantou cuisines.</p>
	<h3>5. Nan’ao Island</h3>
	<caption><a href="caption>maps.app.goo.gl/5E25q9iz2qxLfWGK8">Explore more</a></caption>
	<p>It a island that need around 30-minute drive from Long Hu District. It is a small island with beautiful coastline
		highway and decent seafood.</p>
	<h2>Tips</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Prepare for the hot weather and damp climate.</li>

		<li>Trust the pink beef in hotpot.</li>
		<li>It’s ok that not everyone can accept raw seafood.</li>
		<li>Find a local tour guide is recommended because people in Shantou speak a dialect that sounds totally different
			from Mandarin.</li>

			cuisines", and "find another restaurant".</li>
